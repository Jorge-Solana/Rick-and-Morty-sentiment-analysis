![portada](https://github.com/Jorge-Solana/Rick-and-Morty-sentiment-analysis/blob/main/images/smart-with-api-we-be-must.jpg)


## SCOPE

This project has been developed with the intention fo having an API from which we can later extract the information and make analysis as well as determine the polarity of this data.

## METHODOLOGY

For the creation of this project, the methodology was as follows:

- Extraction of the data we want to have in our database in SQL

- Creating our database in SQL and loading the data

- Construction of the API using Flask

- Coding SQL queries for the API calls with all the methods aviable

- Doing NLP (Natural Language Process) to determine the polarity of our data

- Creating a well structured documentation for further users of the API

- Finally creating some visuals in the notebook for a more comprenhensive data
